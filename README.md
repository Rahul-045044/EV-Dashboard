## About the Dataset
The dataset provides insights into electric vehicle (EV) charging patterns. Key columns include:

1.Vehicle Model: The type of electric vehicle (e.g., BMW i3, Tesla Model 3).  
2.Battery Capacity (kWh): Total energy storage capacity of the vehicle battery.  
3.Charging Station ID: Unique identifier for the charging station.  
4.Charging Station Location: Geographic location of the charging station.  
5.Charging Start Time: Timestamp indicating when the charging session started.  
6.Charging End Time: Timestamp indicating when the charging session ended.  
7.Energy Consumed (kWh): The amount of energy consumed during the charging session.  
8.Charging Duration (hours): The total time spent charging the vehicle.  
9.Charging Rate (kW): The rate at which energy is delivered during the session.  
10.Charging Cost (USD): The cost incurred for the charging session.  
11.Time of Day: Categorized time period (e.g., Morning, Afternoon, Evening).  
12.Day of Week: The day on which the charging session occurred.  
13.State of Charge (Start): Percentage of battery charge at the start of the session.  
14.State of Charge (End %): Percentage of battery charge at the end of the session.  
15.Distance Driven (since last charge): Distance covered since the last charge.  
16.Temperature: Ambient temperature during the charging session.  
17.Vehicle Age: Age of the vehicle in years.  
18.Charger Type: Type of charger used (e.g., Level 1, Level 2, Fast Charger).  
19.User Type: Classification of the user (e.g., Residential, Commercial).

## Objectives  
1.Identify weekly trends in energy consumption to optimize charging station operations and maintenance schedules.

2.Understand energy consumption across vehicle models to allocate resources efficiently and customize infrastructure for high-demand vehicles.

3.Analyze the relationship between location, vehicle model, and charging rates to optimize pricing strategies and infrastructure placement.

4.Explore how battery capacity impacts the driving range to guide product development and battery performance improvements.

5.Identify vehicle models with the highest energy demands to prioritize infrastructure development and target marketing efforts.

6.Analyze daily cost and rate trends to plan promotions and ensure pricing consistency throughout the week.

7.Evaluate location-specific cost differences to ensure fair pricing and identify opportunities to reduce operational costs.

8.Examine how vehicle age impacts driving range to create incentive programs for vehicle upgrades or replacements.

## Managerial Insights
1.Vehicles with higher battery capacity tend to drive longer distances on a single charge.

2.The Tesla Model 3 has the highest total energy consumption among models, indicating high demand.

3.The BMW i3 leads in energy consumption, confirming its high usage frequency.

4.Urban centers like Chicago and Los Angeles have higher charging costs compared to smaller cities.

5.Older vehicles have reduced driving range compared to newer models, reflecting battery degradation over time.

6.Charging rates align closely with costs, ensuring equitable pricing across the week.

7.Older vehicles generally take longer to charge, possibly due to outdated charging systems or reduced battery efficiency.
